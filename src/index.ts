/*
    ts-test
    The simple testing library
    Created by Noah Lanson (2021)

    ts-test is a testing library that takes in a typescript file (.ts) and runs functions that are
    marked by the @test decorator. Functions marked by this decorator will test other functions in
    the code.

    Inspired by the simple and easy to use testing features that Rust and Cargo offer.
